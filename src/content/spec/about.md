# About me

Hello, I am Hao.

I'm a student at [VNUHCM - University of Information Technology](https://en.uit.edu.vn/).

My interest in cyber security began with a curiosity about why my laptop got lag during gaming sessions (now I know not to install any cracked games from Russian forums). Then I went down the rabbit hole of finding hidden flags in binary files, packet captures, and memory dumps. I was alone in this field for a while, but now i meet the security enthusiasts who are somehow still my friends despite my terrible cybersecurity puns.

I'm currently researching malware threat and intrusion detection systems, which include machine learning applications in. This blog functions as my personal library where I share projects, findings, and thoughts on various security topics.
